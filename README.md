# Radiance
Radiance is a fairly simple, light weight mod that only adds a few types of lamps to Minecraft. For now it adds edge lights and colored lamp blocks. In the future it will include panels and vertical edge lights. Planned to feature support for Colored Lux (a fork of Albedo) for colored light coming from the lamps. This mod was made specifically for my custom modpacks, as is meant to be used for lighting certain themes areas of tech heavy bases. Some insipiration come from Project Red lamps, as well edge lamps from Simply Lights (for the edge) and Microblocks (for the vertical edge strip).
